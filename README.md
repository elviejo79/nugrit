What:
    my experiments trynig to create a system
    that looks like Drummer.land
    but that works like graph database.
So that:
    I can create several representations of the same document.
    Like a document, slide show.
    An ibis map can be drawing or a text
    A literate program, can extract a programs into separet files.
    Separate files can be imported into a literate program.
Why:
    Because I think in terms of graphs
    I organize in trees
    But writing are queing (like a document that is a serial, or a slide show, one after the other).
